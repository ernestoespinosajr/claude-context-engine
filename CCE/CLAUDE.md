## Universal Context Recovery System

### MANDATORY: Intelligent Context Discovery Hierarchy
EVERY interaction with Claude Code MUST follow this intelligent discovery sequence:

1. **Logbook Intelligence Check**: Always read `workflow/logbook.md` first (single file, fast scan)
2. **Pattern Matching**: Match user's question against Task Log entries and project context
3. **Relationship Analysis**: Check `workflow/dependencies.md` for task interconnections if patterns suggest relationships
4. **Targeted Context Retrieval**: Read specific task files ONLY when relevant matches found in logbook
5. **Context-Aware Response**: Provide intelligent response with project context + offer task documentation updates

### Intelligent Context Discovery Flow
```bash
# STEP 1: User question → logbook.md (project intelligence hub)
# STEP 2: Pattern match against Task Log, Components Registry, Project Structure  
# STEP 3: If relationships suspected → dependencies.md (task interconnections)
# STEP 4: If specific match found → relevant task file (detailed context)
# STEP 5: Context-aware response + documentation update prompts
```

### Intelligent Pattern Matching System
**Pattern Matching Against Logbook Elements:**

#### Task Log Pattern Matching:
- **Task Names**: Match user keywords against `tsk###-[task-name]` entries
- **Technology Keywords**: Match against task descriptions and achievement goals  
- **Status Keywords**: "in progress", "completed", "failed" → match against task status
- **Component Keywords**: Match against Components Registry entries

#### Project Structure Pattern Matching:
- **File/Directory Names**: Match user questions against project structure
- **Component References**: Link questions to existing components to prevent duplication
- **Service References**: Connect questions to existing services and APIs

#### Dependencies Pattern Matching:  
- **Library/Tool Names**: Match against discovered dependencies
- **Integration Challenges**: Connect problems to known integration patterns
- **Performance Issues**: Link to performance-critical dependencies

### Context Recovery Patterns
```bash
# User mentions problem/fix → Logbook Task Log scan → Pattern match keywords → Find related task → Offer documentation
# User asks technical question → Logbook pattern matching → Dependencies pattern check → Resume specific context  
# User reports success/completion → Logbook task lookup → Pattern match completion indicators → Update status
```

### Pattern Matching Examples:
```bash
# User: "How do I fix the login issue?" 
# Match: "login" → Task Log → "tsk001-user-authentication" → Read task file → Context-aware response

# User: "The payment API is throwing errors"
# Match: "payment" → Dependencies → "Payment integration challenges" → Related tasks → Full context

# User: "I need to optimize this database query"  
# Match: "database" + "optimize" → Task Log → "tsk005-database-performance" → Resume context
```

## Simplified Command System

### Core Commands
The system now uses 5 streamlined commands for all development tasks:

- **@ask**: Smart task analysis and routing - Always check logbook first for context
- **@issue**: Bug fixes and simple tasks (3-layer context)
- **@quick-feature**: Medium features and UI/UX changes (6-layer context)
- **@feature**: Complex features and system changes (11-layer context)
- **dispatch**: Unified task execution with specialized agent dispatch and complete workflow management

### Command Priority
1. Always use @ask first for unfamiliar tasks
2. Let @ask recommend the appropriate command based on complexity analysis
3. Execute with dispatch command for unified task execution with agent specialization

### Core Workflow Principles

**MANDATORY GOVERNANCE RULES:**

All commands MUST enforce these non-negotiable requirements:

1. **Logbook-First Approach**: Always read workflow/logbook.md before any task creation or execution
2. **Task Registration**: All tasks must be registered in Task Log upon creation with ultra-compact format
3. **Phase Validation**: dispatch command requires user validation ("test"/"continue"/"pause") between phases
4. **Progress Documentation**: Every phase completion gets ✅ marker and progress updates
5. **File Workflow**: Tasks move through planned → in-progress → completed with proper status tracking
6. **Duplication Prevention**: Check Project Structure and Components Registry before creating anything

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- Command files contain detailed implementation procedures
- These principles override any conflicting instructions
- Failure to follow workflow invalidates task execution

## Project Logbook Integration

### Automatic Intelligence
The system maintains a central `workflow/logbook.md` that provides:

- **Instant Context**: Quick project overview for fast decision-making
- **Pattern Recognition**: Success/failure patterns from previous tasks
- **Duplication Prevention**: Identifies similar existing work
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time project statistics and trends
- **Institutional Memory**: Key decisions and architectural evolution

### Logbook-First Approach
- @ask command checks logbook before detailed analysis
- All commands automatically update logbook with task status changes
- Provides streamlined efficiency with Context Engineering power

### Integration Points
- **Planning**: New tasks logged with complexity and dependencies
- **Execution**: Status transitions tracked in real-time
- **Completion**: Outcomes and lessons learned captured
- **Analysis**: Historical data used for intelligent recommendations
