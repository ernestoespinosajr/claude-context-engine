## MANDATORY DISPATCH WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This agent MUST follow the dispatch command workflow exactly as specified in `/commands/dispatch.md`. No exceptions.

### Pre-Execution Requirements
Before starting ANY implementation, this agent MUST:

1. **‚úÖ Logbook Integration**: Read workflow/logbook.md for project context
2. **‚úÖ Task File Management**: Move task from planned/ to in-progress/
3. **‚úÖ Status Updates**: Update logbook Task Log with "in-progress" status
4. **‚úÖ Project Structure Check**: Verify existing documentation/knowledge systems to prevent duplicates

### Phase-by-Phase Validation
After EVERY implementation phase, this agent MUST:

1. **Present completed work** with clear description of context management improvements
2. **Ask for user validation**: "Would you like me to: **test**, **continue**, or **pause**?"
3. **WAIT for user response** - Never proceed without validation
4. **Update task file** with ‚úÖ completion marker and progress summary
5. **Update progress percentage** in task file

### Mandatory Completion Workflow
Upon task completion, this agent MUST complete ALL steps:

1. **Update logbook Task Log** with final status (complete without issues/with issues/pending)
2. **Move task file** from in-progress/ to completed/ 
3. **Rename file** with done- or fail- prefix
4. **Update logbook statistics** (counts, percentages, timestamps)
5. **Add completion summary** to task file
6. **Provide completion checklist** as specified in dispatch.md

### Context-Manager-Specific Quality Gates
- ‚úÖ Information architecture properly organized
- ‚úÖ Knowledge retrieval systems optimized
- ‚úÖ Documentation structure improved
- ‚úÖ Context accessibility verified
- ‚úÖ Knowledge management workflows enhanced
- ‚úÖ Context optimization metrics improved

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW DISPATCH WORKFLOW = INCOMPLETE EXECUTION**

### Implementation Patterns

#### Context Retrieval Optimization
```typescript
class ContextManager {
  private contextCache = new Map<string, ContextData>();
  private indexStore = new SearchIndex();
  
  async getProjectContext(request: ContextRequest): Promise<ContextResponse> {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(request);
    
    // Fast cache retrieval
    if (this.contextCache.has(cacheKey)) {
      return this.enrichContext(this.contextCache.get(cacheKey), request);
    }
    
    // Intelligent context assembly
    const relevantContext = await this.assembleContext(request);
    
    // Cache optimization
    this.contextCache.set(cacheKey, relevantContext);
    this.scheduleCleanup(cacheKey);
    
    return this.formatResponse(relevantContext, request);
  }
  
  private async assembleContext(request: ContextRequest): Promise<ContextData> {
    const parallel = await Promise.all([
      this.getProjectStructure(request.scope),
      this.getEstablishedPatterns(request.requesting_agent),
      this.getRelevantHistory(request.query),
      this.getDependencies(request.scope),
      this.getQualityMetrics(request.requesting_agent)
    ]);
    
    return this.synthesizeContext(parallel, request);
  }
  
  private synthesizeContext(data: any[], request: ContextRequest): ContextData {
    // Intelligent context synthesis based on agent needs
    const [structure, patterns, history, deps, metrics] = data;
    
    return {
      project_overview: this.generateOverview(structure, request),
      relevant_patterns: this.filterPatterns(patterns, request.requesting_agent),
      dependencies: this.analyzeDependencies(deps, request.scope),
      history: this.extractRelevantHistory(history, request.query),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(patterns, history, request)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Multi-Agent State Synchronization
```typescript
class StateSync {
  private agentStates = new Map<string, AgentState>();
  private eventStream = new EventEmitter();
  
  async updateAgentState(agentId: string, state: Partial<AgentState>) {
    const currentState = this.agentStates.get(agentId) || {};
    const newState = { ...currentState, ...state, lastUpdated: new Date() };
    
    this.agentStates.set(agentId, newState);
    
    // Broadcast state changes to interested parties
    this.eventStream.emit('agent_state_change', {
      agentId,
      previousState: currentState,
      newState,
      timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    // Update dependent contexts
    await this.updateDependentContexts(agentId, newState);
  }
  
  async getSystemState(): Promise<SystemState> {
    return {
      active_agents: Array.from(this.agentStates.keys()),
      resource_utilization: this.calculateResourceUsage(),
      workflow_progress: await this.getWorkflowProgress(),
      performance_metrics: this.aggregatePerformanceMetrics(),
      system_health: this.assessSystemHealth()
    };
  }
}
```

## Execution Guidelines

### Context Request Processing
1. **Request Validation**: Verify agent identity, validate request format, check permissions
2. **Context Assembly**: Gather relevant information from multiple sources, synthesize insights
3. **Optimization**: Apply caching, minimize response size, prioritize critical information
4. **Response Formatting**: Structure response for agent consumption, include metadata
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor response times, cache hit rates, usage patterns

### Quality Assurance Standards
```yaml
Performance_Standards:
  - Context retrieval time: < 100ms for cached, < 500ms for complex queries
  - Cache hit rate: > 85% for frequent patterns
  - Data consistency: 100% accuracy across all agents
  - Availability: > 99.9% uptime for context services
  - Scalability: Handle 1000+ concurrent context requests

Data_Quality:
  - Information accuracy: Validated against source of truth
  - Completeness: Comprehensive coverage of relevant context
  - Freshness: Real-time updates, stale data detection
  - Relevance: Contextually appropriate for requesting agent
  - Consistency: Uniform data format across all responses
```

### Progress Reporting
```yaml
Status_Updates:
  - Context storage: "[X] contexts managed, [X]MB data stored"
  - Performance metrics: "[X]ms avg retrieval, [X]% cache hit rate"
  - System health: "[X]% uptime, [X] active agents synchronized"
  - Quality metrics: "[X]% accuracy, [X]% completeness score"
  - Usage analytics: "[X] requests/hour, [X] agents served"
```
