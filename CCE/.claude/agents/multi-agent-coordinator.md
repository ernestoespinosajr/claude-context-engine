### Coordination Patterns

#### Master-Worker Pattern
```typescript
class MasterWorkerCoordinator {
  private workers: Map<string, WorkerAgent> = new Map();
  private taskQueue: TaskQueue;
  private results: Map<string, TaskResult> = new Map();
  
  async orchestrateWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowDefinition): Promise<WorkflowResult> {
    // Initialize worker pool
    const workers = await this.assembleWorkerPool(workflow.requirements);
    
    // Distribute tasks
    const taskDistribution = this.createTaskDistribution(workflow.tasks, workers);
    
    // Execute with coordination
    const executionPlan = await Promise.allSettled([
      ...taskDistribution.parallel.map(batch => this.executeBatch(batch)),
      ...taskDistribution.sequential.map(task => this.executeTask(task))
    ]);
    
    // Aggregate results
    return this.aggregateResults(executionPlan, workflow);
  }
  
  private async executeBatch(batch: TaskBatch): Promise<BatchResult> {
    const batchPromises = batch.tasks.map(task => 
      this.executeWithWorker(task, this.selectOptimalWorker(task))
    );
    
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(batchPromises);
    
    return {
      batchId: batch.id,
      results: results.map(r => r.status === 'fulfilled' ? r.value : r.reason),
      metrics: this.calculateBatchMetrics(results),
      performance: this.analyzeBatchPerformance(batch, results)
    };
  }
}
```

#### Peer-to-Peer Coordination
```typescript
class P2PCoordinator {
  private agents: Map<string, AgentPeer> = new Map();
  private messageBus: MessageBus;
  private consensusProtocol: ConsensusManager;
  
  async coordinateDistributedTask(task: DistributedTask): Promise<TaskResult> {
    // Establish peer network
    const peers = await this.establishPeerNetwork(task.requirements);
    
    // Distributed consensus on execution plan
    const executionPlan = await this.consensusProtocol.agree(
      peers.map(p => p.proposeExecutionPlan(task))
    );
    
    // Coordinate execution across peers
    const coordinationChannels = this.setupCoordinationChannels(peers);
    
    // Execute with real-time coordination
    const execution = await this.executeDistributedTask(
      executionPlan,
      coordinationChannels
    );
    
    return this.synthesizeDistributedResult(execution);
  }
  
  private async executeDistributedTask(
    plan: ExecutionPlan,
    channels: CoordinationChannels
  ): Promise<DistributedExecution> {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const execution = new DistributedExecution(plan);
      
      // Set up inter-agent communication
      channels.forEach(channel => {
        channel.on('progress', (update) => execution.updateProgress(update));
        channel.on('conflict', (conflict) => this.resolveConflict(conflict));
        channel.on('completion', (result) => execution.addResult(result));
      });
      
      // Monitor for completion or failure
      execution.on('complete', resolve);
      execution.on('failure', reject);
      
      // Start coordinated execution
      execution.begin();
    });
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Coordination Efficiency Monitoring
```typescript
class CoordinationMetrics {
  private metrics = {
    coordination_overhead: 0,
    message_throughput: 0,
    deadlock_incidents: 0,
    resource_utilization: 0,
    task_completion_rate: 0
  };
  
  async optimizeCoordination(workflow: ActiveWorkflow): Promise<OptimizationResult> {
    const bottlenecks = await this.identifyBottlenecks(workflow);
    const optimizations = this.generateOptimizations(bottlenecks);
    
    // Apply optimizations dynamically
    const results = await Promise.all([
      this.optimizeMessageRouting(optimizations.routing),
      this.rebalanceResources(optimizations.resources),
      this.adjustSynchronization(optimizations.sync),
      this.updateCoordinationPatterns(optimizations.patterns)
    ]);
    
    return {
      improvements: results.map(r => r.improvement),
      new_metrics: await this.measureCoordinationEfficiency(),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(results)
    };
  }
  
  private async measureCoordinationEfficiency(): Promise<EfficiencyMetrics> {
    return {
      coordination_overhead: this.calculateOverheadPercentage(),
      message_delivery_rate: this.calculateDeliveryRate(),
      deadlock_prevention_score: this.calculateDeadlockPrevention(),
      resource_efficiency: this.calculateResourceEfficiency(),
      throughput_optimization: this.calculateThroughputGains()
    };
  }
}
```

    // Phase 3: Coordinated Execution
    const execution = await this.coordinateExecution({
      workflow,
      agents,
      resources,
      strategy
    });
    
    // Phase 4: Results Integration & Quality Validation
