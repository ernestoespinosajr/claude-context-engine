@include shared/critical-thinking.yml#Critical_Thinking_Framework

Examples:
- `@issue "fix login button not responding on iOS"` - Platform-specific bug fix
- `@issue "correct typo in error message"` - Simple text fix
- `@issue "update dependency version for security patch"` - Maintenance task
- `@issue "fix memory leak in image loading"` - Performance bug fix

## Lightweight Context Architecture (3-Layer)

### Layer 1: Problem Context
**Focus**: Clear problem identification and current state
- **Issue Description**: What specifically is broken or needs fixing
- **Current Behavior**: How the system currently behaves (incorrectly)
- **Expected Behavior**: How the system should behave
- **Error Analysis**: Error messages, logs, or symptoms
- **Reproduction Steps**: How to consistently reproduce the issue

### Layer 2: Solution Context  
**Focus**: Root cause analysis and solution approach
- **Root Cause**: What is actually causing the problem
- **Impact Analysis**: What parts of the system are affected
- **Solution Strategy**: High-level approach to fixing the issue
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong with the fix
- **Alternative Solutions**: Other ways to address the problem

### Layer 3: Implementation Context
**Focus**: Practical implementation and verification
- **Implementation Steps**: Step-by-step fix procedure
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the fix works
- **Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if something goes wrong
- **Documentation**: What needs to be updated after the fix

## Process

### 0. Context Integration (Priority 1)
#### Context File Reference
- **Automatic Lookup**: Check for matching context file `workflow/00-Context/ct###-[task-name].md`
- **Context Integration**: If found, reference all analysis from context file
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify any additional technical details needed beyond context analysis
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure issue plan aligns with context recommendations

#### Logbook Consultation
- **Task Log Review**: Check logbook.md for similar completed issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from previous similar issue resolution patterns
- **Component Reuse**: Identify existing solutions that can be leveraged

### 1. Issue Analysis & Triage
- **Problem Identification**: Clearly understand what needs to be fixed
- **Scope Assessment**: Ensure this is truly a simple issue (not a hidden complex feature)
- **Impact Evaluation**: Understand who and what is affected
- **Urgency Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority

### 2. Root Cause Investigation
- **Symptom Analysis**: Look beyond surface symptoms to find root cause
- **Code Investigation**: Examine relevant code sections for the actual problem
- **Dependency Check**: Verify if external dependencies are involved
- **Historical Context**: Check if this issue has occurred before

### 3. Solution Development
- **Minimal Viable Fix**: Identify the smallest change that resolves the issue
- **Side Effect Analysis**: Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality
- **Testing Strategy**: Plan how to verify the fix works correctly
- **Documentation Updates**: Identify any docs that need updating

### 4. Implementation & Verification
- **Code Changes**: Implement the minimal fix
- **Local Testing**: Verify fix works in development environment
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure no existing functionality is broken
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

## Issue Classification

### Critical Issues (Immediate Fix Required)
- Security vulnerabilities
- System crashes or complete failures
- Data loss or corruption
- Payment or authentication failures

### High Priority Issues
- Major functionality broken for significant user base
- Performance degradation affecting user experience
- Integration failures with critical systems

### Medium Priority Issues  
- Minor functionality issues affecting some users
- UI/UX problems that don't prevent core functionality
- Non-critical performance issues

### Low Priority Issues
- Cosmetic issues
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Documentation updates
- Code cleanup tasks

## File Handling

### Task Code Assignment
- **Sequential Numbering**: Check `workflow/01-planned/` directory to determine next available tsk### number
- **Context Reference**: Link to corresponding context file if created by @ask command
- **Logbook Registration**: Update logbook.md Task Log with new entry

### Issue Documentation
Create lightweight issue file in `workflow/01-planned/tsk###-[name].md`:

```markdown
# Issue Plan: [Issue Name]
*Task ID: tsk###-[task-name]*
*Context Reference: ct###-[task-name] (if applicable)*
*Created: [Date]*
*Planning by: @issue command*

## Context Summary
[Reference from ct###-[task-name].md if available, or brief analysis]

## Problem Summary
[Brief description of the issue]

## Current vs Expected Behavior
- **Current**: [What happens now]
- **Expected**: [What should happen]

## Root Cause Analysis
[What is actually causing the problem]

## Solution Approach
[How we plan to fix it - aligned with context recommendations if available]

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

## Testing Plan
- [How to verify the fix works]
- [What regression tests to run]

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: [Low | Medium | High]
- **Potential Issues**: [What could go wrong]
- **Rollback Plan**: [How to undo if needed]

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Issue is resolved
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Appropriate tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Agent Recommendations
- **Recommended Agent**: [Based on context analysis]
- **Dispatch Command**: `dispatch [agent] --context="tsk###-[task-name]" [--persona-flags]`
```

### Workflow Integration
- **Context**: Context files remain in `workflow/00-Context/` (permanent reference)
- **Planning**: Task files start in `workflow/01-planned/`
- **Execution**: Move to `workflow/02-in-progress/` during dispatch
- **Completion**: Move to `workflow/03-completed/` with status suffix when done
- **Naming**: `tsk###-[descriptive-name].md` format with sequential numbering

## Quality Gates

### Level 1: Fix Validation
- Issue is actually resolved
- Fix doesn't introduce new bugs
- Code follows project conventions
- Change is minimal and focused

### Level 2: Integration Check
- No regression in existing functionality
- Integration tests still pass
- No new error messages or warnings
- Performance hasn't degraded

### Level 3: Documentation & Cleanup
- Relevant documentation updated
- Code comments added where needed
- Temporary debug code removed
- Issue tracking updated

## Best Practices

### Keep It Simple
- **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest change that fixes the issue
- **Single Focus**: Address only the specific issue, don't add unrelated improvements
- **Clear Commit Messages**: Explain what was fixed and why
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests that reproduce the issue, then fix until tests pass

### Safety First
- **Backup Critical Data**: Before making changes that could affect data
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for fixes that might need quick rollback
- **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy fixes gradually when possible
- **Monitor Post-Fix**: Watch metrics and logs after deploying fixes

### Communication
- **Clear Documentation**: Explain what was wrong and how it was fixed
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Notify relevant team members of critical fixes
- **User Communication**: Inform users when fixes address issues they reported

## Integration with Other Commands

### Escalation Path
If during issue investigation you discover it's actually more complex:
- **Promote to Quick Feature**: `@ask "re-evaluate as quick-feature"`
- **Promote to Full Feature**: `@ask "re-evaluate as complex feature"`
- **Split into Multiple Issues**: Break down into smaller, manageable pieces

### Dependencies
- Issues can depend on other issues or features
- Track dependencies in `workflow/dependencies.md`
- Block issue execution if dependencies aren't resolved

## Output Requirements

Every @issue response MUST include:

```markdown
# ðŸ”§ Issue Analysis: [Issue Name]

## Problem Summary
[Clear, concise problem description]

## Root Cause  
[What's actually causing the issue]

## Solution Strategy
[How we're going to fix it]

## ðŸ¤– Agent Execution Decision

**Execution Approach**: `[command|agent]`

**For Command Execution** (Simple fixes):
- âœ… **Direct Implementation**: Use @start for immediate, straightforward fixes
- âœ… **Single File Changes**: Issue affects only 1-2 files with clear fix
- âœ… **No Domain Expertise**: Fix doesn't require specialized knowledge
- âœ… **Quick Validation**: Can be tested and validated quickly

**For Agent Execution** (Complex issues):
- ðŸ¤– **Recommended Agent**: `[frontend|backend|mobile|full-stack]`
- ðŸŽ¯ **Why Agent?**: [Specific complexity requiring specialized expertise]
- ðŸ”„ **Agent Benefits**: [Multi-step analysis, domain knowledge, autonomous debugging]

**Agent Dispatch Command** (if recommended):
```bash
# After this planning is approved, execute with specialized agent:
dispatch [recommended-agent] --context="issue-[name]" [--persona-flags]
```

**Decision Factors**:
- **Issue Complexity**: Simple fix vs requires investigation/analysis
- **Domain Knowledge**: Generic fix vs requires specialized expertise  
- **Multi-Step Process**: Single change vs complex debugging workflow
- **Testing Requirements**: Simple validation vs comprehensive testing

## Implementation Plan
[Step-by-step fix approach]

## Risk Assessment
[What could go wrong and mitigation]

## Success Criteria
[How we'll know it's fixed]
```

## MANDATORY TASK LOG REGISTRATION

IMMEDIATELY after creating an issue plan, you MUST update `workflow/logbook.md`:

### Step 1: Register in Task Log Section
Add entry in **Task Log** section with exact ultra-compact format:
```markdown
`@issue-login-ios-bug` | pending | /workflow/planned/issue-login-ios-bug.md | Fix login button not responding on iOS
`@issue-memory-leak` | pending | /workflow/planned/issue-memory-leak.md | Fix image loading memory leak
`@issue-typo-error-msg` | pending | /workflow/planned/issue-typo-error-msg.md | Correct typo in error message
```

**Format Rules**:
- Task name: issue-[kebab-case], descriptive but short  
- Achievement goal: 1-6 words max, what gets fixed
- No extra spaces, under 50 characters total for goal

### Step 2: Update Logbook Statistics
- Increment "Planned" count in Quick Overview
- Add to "By Type" â†’ Issues/Bugs counter
- Add to appropriate complexity range (typically 1-4)
- Update "Last Activity" timestamp

### Step 3: Check Project Structure
Before creating the issue plan, scan the **Project Structure** section in logbook.md to verify:
- Understanding of current component structure
- No conflicts with existing implementations

## User Feedback Requirements

At the beginning of EVERY response, include:
1. Confirmation that this is being treated as a simple issue
2. Brief description of the problem understood
3. Estimated complexity and time to fix
4. Any concerns about the issue being more complex than it appears
5. Clear next steps for resolution
