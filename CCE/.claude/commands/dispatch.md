## MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step 0: Intelligent Context Discovery & Task Detection
FIRST, ALWAYS follow intelligent context discovery hierarchy:

1. **Logbook Intelligence Scan**: Read `workflow/logbook.md` first (project intelligence hub)
2. **Pattern Matching**: Match user context against Task Log entries, Components Registry, Project Structure
3. **Relationship Analysis**: Check `workflow/dependencies.md` for task interconnections if patterns suggest relationships  
4. **Targeted Context Retrieval**: Read specific task files ONLY when relevant matches found in logbook
5. **Smart Context Recovery**: If patterns suggest user is working on known task, offer to resume with full context
6. **Issue Documentation**: If user mentions fixes/solutions, prompt to document in relevant task found via logbook

**Intelligent Context Discovery Examples**:
```bash
# User says: "I fixed the authentication bug"
# STEP 1: Read logbook.md ‚Üí Find "tsk001-user-authentication | in-progress"
# STEP 2: Read specific task file ‚Üí Get full context
# System response: "I found tsk001-user-authentication in logbook as in-progress. Should I document this fix in the execution log?"

# User asks: "How do I handle this database error?"  
# STEP 1: Read logbook.md ‚Üí Pattern match "database" ‚Üí Find related tasks
# STEP 2: Check dependencies.md ‚Üí See database dependencies
# STEP 3: Read relevant task file ‚Üí Get specific context
# System response: "I found tsk003-database-optimization in your logbook with database dependencies. Is this related to that task?"
```

**Intelligent Context Prompts**:
- "I found [task-name] in your project logbook. Should I update the execution log with this fix?"
- "Your logbook shows [related-tasks] involving similar technology. Want me to document this solution?"
- "I see dependencies between [task-A] and [task-B] in your project. Should I update both task files?"

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Validation & Context Setup
BEFORE dispatching ANY agent, you MUST:

1. **Read workflow/logbook.md** - Check Task Log, project structure, and existing components
2. **Locate task file** in workflow/01-planned/ directory
3. **Move task file** from workflow/01-planned/ to workflow/02-in-progress/
4. **Enhance task file** with issue tracking and context persistence sections
5. **Update logbook.md** Task Log entry status from "pending" to "in-progress"

### Step 1.5: Context Persistence Setup
When moving task to in-progress, AUTOMATICALLY ADD these sections:

```markdown
## üîß Execution Log & Issue Tracking
*This section auto-updates during task execution to prevent context loss*

### Problems Encountered & Fixes Applied
*Document ALL issues found during execution - automatically referenced by system*

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution Applied | Time Invested | Lessons Learned |
|-------|------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Auto-populated during execution] | [Analysis] | [Fix description] | [Time] | [Insights] |

### Discovered Dependencies
*Auto-discovered during execution - updates dependencies.md*
- [New dependencies found during implementation]
- [Unexpected integrations needed]
- [Tools/libraries discovered]

### Context Persistence Checkpoints
*Maintain context across sessions and breaks*
- **Current Phase**: [Implementation/Testing/Debugging/Completion]
- **Last Action**: [What was last worked on]
- **Next Steps**: [What should be done next]
- **Blockers**: [Current obstacles or questions]
- **Key Decisions**: [Important decisions made during execution]

### Testing & Validation Issues
*Track testing problems and solutions*
- **Test Results**: [Pass/Fail status with details]
- **Edge Cases Found**: [Unexpected scenarios discovered]
- **Performance Issues**: [Speed/memory/resource problems]
- **User Experience Issues**: [UX problems discovered during testing]
```

### Step 2: Mandatory Issue Documentation During Execution
DURING task execution, agents MUST document EVERY action immediately:

1. **Real-Time Problem Logging**: Document EVERY issue encountered immediately in task file
2. **Solution Documentation**: Record ALL fixes and workarounds applied immediately
3. **Progress Updates**: Update task file with ‚úÖ completion markers after EACH phase
4. **Dependency Discovery**: Log new dependencies/tools/libraries discovered immediately
5. **Context Checkpoints**: Update current phase and next steps regularly in task file
6. **Testing Issue Tracking**: Document all testing problems and edge cases immediately

**CRITICAL**: Agents CANNOT complete a phase without updating the task file with progress documentation

**Mandatory Updates to Task File**:
```markdown
## üîß Latest Execution Update
*Last Updated: [Timestamp]*
*Current Phase: [Implementation/Testing/Debugging]*

### Most Recent Issue Found
**Problem**: [Description of latest issue]
**Root Cause**: [Why it happened] 
**Solution**: [How it was fixed]
**Time Investment**: [How long it took]
**Lesson Learned**: [Key insight for future]

### Current Status
- **Progress**: [% complete or current milestone]
- **Next Action**: [What needs to be done next]
- **Blockers**: [Any obstacles]
- **Tests Status**: [Passing/Failing/Not yet run]
```

**Auto-Documentation Triggers**:
- When agent encounters any error ‚Üí Document immediately
- When agent applies any fix ‚Üí Record solution
- When agent discovers new dependency ‚Üí Update dependencies.md
- When agent completes phase ‚Üí Update context checkpoint
- When testing reveals issues ‚Üí Log in testing section

**Status Update Examples**:
```markdown
`@user-auth-biometrics` | in-progress | /workflow/in-progress/user-auth-biometrics.md | Add biometric login system
`@issue-login-ios-bug` | in-progress | /workflow/in-progress/issue-login-ios-bug.md | Fix login button not responding on iOS  
`@dark-mode-toggle` | in-progress | /workflow/in-progress/dark-mode-toggle.md | Add theme switching to settings
```

### Step 2: Task Type Recognition & Agent Selection
The system automatically detects task type by analyzing:

**File Location & Naming Patterns**:
- `issue-*.md` ‚Üí Issue/Bug Fix (3-layer context)
- `*.md` in planned/ (no prefix) ‚Üí Quick Feature (6-layer context)  
- Complex features ‚Üí Full Feature (11-layer context)

**Content Analysis**:
- **Issue Indicators**: "fix", "bug", "broken", error messages, specific platform issues
- **Quick Feature Indicators**: Single component, UI changes, specific functionality
- **Complex Feature Indicators**: Multiple systems, architectural changes, cross-cutting concerns

## Context Handoff Process

### 1. Planning Context Transfer
The agent receives complete planning context including:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Architecture decisions and constraints  
- Technical specifications and dependencies
- Quality gates and success metrics
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 2. Agent Initialization
- Load specialized agent configuration
- Apply recommended persona specializations
- Configure appropriate MCP modules
- Set up agent-specific context optimization
- Initialize quality assurance standards

### 3. Autonomous Execution
- Agent works independently in separate context
- Makes implementation decisions based on expertise
- Follows established patterns and best practices
- Handles errors and edge cases autonomously
- Provides progress updates without verbose explanations

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Agent validates implementation against acceptance criteria
- Runs automated tests and quality checks
- Ensures security and performance standards
- Documents implementation decisions and changes
- Prepares deployment-ready code

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Agent Workflows
```bash
# Backend-first development
dispatch backend --context="user-api"
# After backend completion:
dispatch frontend --context="user-interface" --depends-on="user-api"
```

### Parallel Agent Development
```bash
# Simultaneous development (when possible)
dispatch backend --context="chat-api" &
dispatch frontend --context="chat-ui" --api-contract="chat-api"
```

### Agent Handoff Workflows  
```bash
# Mobile agent ‚Üí Backend agent collaboration for API needs
dispatch mobile --context="mobile-app-ui"
# If backend API needed:
dispatch backend --context="mobile-app-backend" --extends="mobile-app-ui"
```

## File Lifecycle Management

### Universal File Handling
```markdown
## File Transition Log

**Start**: `workflow/01-planned/tsk###-[task-name].md`
**Execution**: `workflow/02-in-progress/tsk###-[task-name].md`
**Completion**: 
  - Success: `workflow/03-completed/tsk###-[task-name]-completed.md`
  - Failure: `workflow/03-completed/tsk###-[task-name]-failed.md`

**Status Updates**: Real-time updates to task file during execution
**Dependency Updates**: Automatic dependency resolution tracking
**Progress Logging**: Detailed execution log for future reference
**Logbook Updates**: Automatic updates to workflow/logbook.md on status changes
```

### Step 3: MANDATORY Final Documentation & Completion  
Upon reaching 100% completion, you MUST complete ALL of these steps:

**PRE-COMPLETION VALIDATION**: Before moving to completion, verify task file contains:
- ‚úÖ All phases marked complete with timestamps
- ‚úÖ All issues encountered documented with solutions
- ‚úÖ All testing results and edge cases documented
- ‚úÖ Final implementation summary with quality gates met

#### 3.1: Update Task Status in Logbook
IMMEDIATELY update the Task Log section in workflow/logbook.md:
- Change status from "in-progress" to completion status:
  - "complete without issues" (fully successful)
  - "complete with issues to fix" (works but has problems)  
  - "pending" (incomplete or paused)
- Update file path to new completed location

**Final Status Examples**:
```markdown
`tsk###-user-auth-biometrics` | complete without issues | /workflow/03-completed/tsk###-user-auth-biometrics-completed.md | Add biometric login system
`tsk###-issue-memory-leak` | complete with issues to fix | /workflow/03-completed/tsk###-issue-memory-leak-completed.md | Fix image loading memory leak - needs optimization
`tsk###-dark-mode-toggle` | pending | /workflow/02-in-progress/tsk###-dark-mode-toggle.md | Add theme switching to settings - paused for design review
```

#### 3.2: Move and Rename Task File
1. **Move file** from workflow/02-in-progress/ to workflow/03-completed/
2. **Rename file** with appropriate suffix:
   - Success: `tsk###-[task-name]-completed.md`
   - Failure: `tsk###-[task-name]-failed.md`

#### 3.3: Update Logbook Statistics
Update the Quick Overview section in workflow/logbook.md:
- Decrement "In Progress" count
- Increment "Completed" count (success or failure)
- Update "Last Activity" timestamp
- Recalculate success rate percentage

#### 3.4: Document Completion Details
Add completion summary to the task file before moving:
```markdown
## COMPLETION SUMMARY
- **Status**: [Complete/Failed/Paused]
- **Completion Date**: [Date]
- **Issues Encountered**: [Any problems faced]
- **Solutions Applied**: [How problems were solved]
- **Final Notes**: [Key insights or remaining work]
- **Quality Gates Met**: [Which quality criteria were satisfied]
```

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Agent Validation Requirements
Each agent must satisfy these quality gates before completion:

**Code Quality:**
- ‚úÖ Type safety and error handling
- ‚úÖ Code follows established patterns
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing coverage
- ‚úÖ Documentation and examples provided

**Performance Standards:**
- ‚úÖ Meets performance benchmarks  
- ‚úÖ Optimized for target platform
- ‚úÖ Efficient resource utilization
- ‚úÖ Scalability considerations addressed

**Security Compliance:**
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization
- ‚úÖ Authentication and authorization
- ‚úÖ Data protection measures
- ‚úÖ Vulnerability assessment completed

**Integration Testing:**
- ‚úÖ API contracts validated
- ‚úÖ End-to-end workflows tested
- ‚úÖ Error scenarios handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ Deployment readiness confirmed

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Agent Error Resolution
Agents handle errors autonomously through:

**Automatic Recovery:**
- Retry failed operations with exponential backoff
- Fallback to alternative implementation approaches  
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- Self-correction based on error patterns

**Escalation Triggers:**
- External service dependencies unavailable
- Conflicting requirements or constraints discovered
- Security vulnerabilities requiring architectural changes
- Performance targets cannot be achieved with current approach

**Recovery Communication:**
- Clear explanation of issue and attempted solutions
- Alternative approaches considered and their trade-offs
- Recommendation for path forward with rationale
- Impact assessment on overall project timeline

## Progress Monitoring

### Agent Progress Updates
Agents provide milestone-based progress reporting:

**Implementation Phases:**
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Phase**: Initial setup and structure
- üîß **Core Implementation**: Primary functionality development  
- üß™ **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- ‚ö° **Optimization Phase**: Performance and security tuning
- üì¶ **Deployment Phase**: Production readiness preparation

**Status Communication:**
- Milestone completion with acceptance criteria validation
- Performance metrics and benchmarks achieved
- Integration points validated and tested
- Quality gates passed with evidence
- Next phase dependencies identified

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check agent status
agent status [agent-name]

# View agent progress  
agent progress [task-name]

# Get agent logs
agent logs [agent-name] --task="[task-name]"

# Agent health check
agent health [agent-name]
```

## Phase-by-Phase Validation Process

### Step 2: Mandatory User Validation
After completing EACH implementation phase, you MUST:

1. **Present completed phase** to user with clear description of what was accomplished
2. **Ask for validation**: "Would you like me to: **test**, **continue**, or **pause**?"
3. **WAIT for user response** - Never proceed without user validation
4. **Update task file** with ‚úÖ completion marker and 1-2 line summary
5. **Update progress percentage** in task file

### Interactive Execution Patterns
```markdown
üéØ TASK EXECUTION: [Task Name] with [Agent]

## Current Status
- **Phase**: [Current implementation phase]
- **Progress**: [X/Y tasks completed]
- **Next Action**: [What's happening next]
- **Agent Status**: [Agent progress and current focus]

## Continue?
- `test` - Test current implementation and continue
- `continue` - Continue to next phase  
- `pause` - Pause and save current progress
- `details` - Show detailed progress and next steps
- `escalate` - Increase complexity level and re-plan
```

## Best Practices

### When to Dispatch Agents
‚úÖ **Dispatch agents when:**
- Task complexity requires deep domain expertise
- Multi-step implementation across multiple files/systems
- Performance optimization requiring specialized knowledge
- Integration patterns requiring domain-specific understanding
- Quality assurance demanding comprehensive testing strategies

‚ùå **Don't dispatch agents for:**
- Simple configuration changes
- Single-file modifications
- Basic text or documentation updates
- Tasks requiring constant human decision-making
- Exploratory research or investigation tasks

### Agent Selection Strategy
1. **Analyze Task Domain**: Determine primary technical domain (frontend, backend, mobile)
2. **Assess Complexity**: Complex tasks benefit most from agent specialization
3. **Consider Integration**: Complex tasks may need agent coordination or full-stack agents
4. **Evaluate Timeline**: Agents work best for tasks requiring sustained focus
5. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure planning context provides sufficient detail

### Context Quality for Agents
**High-Quality Context Includes:**
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Technical constraints and dependencies  
- Architecture decisions already made
- Quality standards and performance targets
- Security and compliance requirements

**Poor Context Signals:**
- Vague or incomplete requirements
- Missing technical specifications
- Unclear success criteria
- Ambiguous architecture decisions
- Conflicting or contradictory constraints

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES

### NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS
The dispatch command WILL NOT be considered successfully executed unless ALL of the following are completed:

1. **‚úÖ Task Log Updated**: Status changed to completion status with correct file path
2. **‚úÖ File Moved**: Task file moved from in-progress/ to completed/ with proper naming  
3. **‚úÖ Statistics Updated**: Logbook statistics decremented/incremented correctly
4. **‚úÖ Completion Summary Added**: Task file contains completion documentation
5. **‚úÖ User Validation**: Each phase validated by user before proceeding
6. **‚úÖ Agent Quality Gates**: All agent-specific quality requirements met
7. **‚úÖ Progress Documentation**: All phases documented with ‚úÖ markers in task file
8. **‚úÖ Issue Tracking Complete**: All problems/solutions documented in task file

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE THESE STEPS = INCOMPLETE EXECUTION**

**AGENTS MUST STOP AND REQUEST COMPLETION VALIDATION** if any documentation step is missed

Any dispatch execution that skips these mandatory steps must be considered failed and should be restarted with proper completion workflow.

## Output Requirements

Every dispatch response MUST include:

```markdown
# ü§ñ Dispatching Agent: [Agent Name] for Task: [Task Name]

## Pre-Execution Check ‚úÖ
- Logbook reviewed for context
- Task file located and moved to in-progress
- Project structure validated
- Agent specialized for task domain

## Task Analysis
- **Type**: [Issue | Quick Feature | Complex Feature]
- **Context Level**: [3-Layer | 6-Layer | 11-Layer]  
- **Estimated Complexity**: [1-10]
- **Active Agent**: [Agent specialization and role]
- **Active Personas**: [List of personas]
- **MCP Modules**: [Active MCP integrations]

## Agent Execution Plan
[Phase-by-phase execution strategy with validation points]

## Phase 1: [Phase Name] - Agent Implementation
[Current agent implementation work with specialization]

---
**Validation Point**: After completing this phase, I will ask for your validation before proceeding.
```
