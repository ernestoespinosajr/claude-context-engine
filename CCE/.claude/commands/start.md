@include shared/critical-thinking.yml#Critical_Thinking_Framework

Examples:
- `@start "user-authentication-biometrics"` - Execute complex feature
- `@start "dark-mode-toggle"` - Execute quick feature
- `@start "login-button-fix"` - Execute issue/bug fix
- `@start "payment-processing-system"` - Execute any planned task

## Intelligent Task Detection

### 1. Task Type Recognition
The system automatically detects task type by analyzing:

**File Location & Naming Patterns**:
- `issue-*.md` ‚Üí Issue/Bug Fix (3-layer context)
- `*.md` in planned/ (no prefix) ‚Üí Quick Feature (6-layer context)  
- Complex features ‚Üí Full Feature (11-layer context)

**Content Analysis**:
- **Issue Indicators**: "fix", "bug", "broken", error messages, specific platform issues
- **Quick Feature Indicators**: Single component, UI changes, specific functionality
- **Complex Feature Indicators**: Multiple systems, architectural changes, cross-cutting concerns

**Complexity Scoring**:
- **Scope**: Single component vs. multiple systems
- **Integration**: Isolated vs. cross-system impact
- **Architecture**: Component-level vs. system-level changes
- **Time Investment**: Hours vs. days vs. weeks

### 2. Context Architecture Selection

Based on detection, automatically apply appropriate context level:

```markdown
## Detected Task Type: [Issue | Quick Feature | Complex Feature]

**Context Level**: [3-Layer | 6-Layer | 11-Layer]
**Estimated Complexity**: [1-10]
**Execution Strategy**: [Focused Fix | Balanced Development | Comprehensive Engineering]
```

## Unified Execution Process

### Phase 1: Task Loading & Validation

#### File Discovery & Loading
- **Locate Task File**: Search workflow directories for specified task
- **Validate File Status**: Ensure task is in correct status for execution
- **Load Task Context**: Import all task documentation and requirements
- **Dependency Check**: Verify all dependencies are met before starting

#### Context Preparation
- **Context Level Assignment**: Apply appropriate context architecture (3/6/11 layers)
- **Persona Activation**: Activate recommended personas based on task type
- **Environment Setup**: Prepare development environment for task execution
- **Workflow Transition**: Move task file from `planned/` to `in-progress/`

### Phase 2: Execution Strategy Application

#### Issue Execution (3-Layer Context)
```markdown
üîß EXECUTING ISSUE: [Task Name]
Context Level: 3-Layer (Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Implementation)
Focus: Direct problem resolution with minimal scope
```

**Process**:
1. **Problem Analysis**: Understand and reproduce the issue
2. **Solution Implementation**: Apply focused fix
3. **Validation**: Verify fix works and doesn't break existing functionality

#### Quick Feature Execution (6-Layer Context)
```markdown
üöÄ EXECUTING QUICK FEATURE: [Task Name]
Context Level: 6-Layer (Goals ‚Üí UX ‚Üí Technical ‚Üí Dependencies ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Quality)
Focus: Balanced feature development with user experience focus
```

**Process**:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand user needs and acceptance criteria
2. **Design & Planning**: Plan user experience and technical approach
3. **Implementation**: Build feature in logical phases
4. **Integration & Testing**: Ensure feature works with existing systems
5. **Quality Validation**: Verify feature meets all requirements

#### Complex Feature Execution (11-Layer Context)
```markdown
üèóÔ∏è EXECUTING COMPLEX FEATURE: [Task Name]
Context Level: 11-Layer (Full Context Engineering Architecture)
Focus: Comprehensive system development with architectural considerations
```

**Process**:
1. **Context Engineering**: Apply full 11-layer context architecture
2. **Architectural Planning**: Design system-level changes and impacts
3. **Phased Implementation**: Execute in carefully planned phases
4. **Integration Management**: Handle complex system integrations
5. **Quality Engineering**: Apply comprehensive quality gates and validation

### Phase 3: Implementation Execution

#### Universal Implementation Patterns

**Progressive Enhancement**:
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Add complexity incrementally
- Validate at each step before proceeding

**Continuous Validation**:
- Apply quality gates appropriate to task complexity
- Test integration points continuously
- Validate user experience at each phase

**Adaptive Complexity**:
- Monitor if task complexity changes during implementation
- Escalate or de-escalate context level as needed
- Adjust approach based on discovered requirements

### Phase 4: Completion & Transition

#### Completion Validation
Based on task type, apply appropriate completion criteria:

**Issue Completion**:
- [ ] Problem is resolved
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Fix is tested and validated
- [ ] Relevant documentation updated

**Quick Feature Completion**:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] User experience validated
- [ ] Integration testing completed
- [ ] Performance requirements met

**Complex Feature Completion**:
- [ ] All 11-layer context requirements satisfied
- [ ] Architectural integrity maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive testing completed
- [ ] Full documentation and knowledge transfer done

#### File Transition
- **Success**: Move from `in-progress/` to `completed/` and rename to `done-[task-name].md`
- **Failure**: Move from `in-progress/` to `completed/` and rename to `fail-[task-name].md`
- **Pause**: Keep in `in-progress/` with status updated in document
- **Update Dependencies**: Mark task as completed in dependency tracking

## Intelligent Features

### Context Escalation
If during execution the task proves more complex than initially assessed:

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLEXITY ESCALATION DETECTED

Original Assessment: [Issue/Quick Feature]
Current Assessment: [Quick Feature/Complex Feature]

Recommended Action:
1. Pause current execution
2. Re-analyze with higher context level
3. Create new plan with appropriate complexity
4. Resume with enhanced approach
```

### Smart Persona Integration
Automatically activate recommended personas based on:
- **Task Type**: Issue (minimal), Quick Feature (1-2 personas), Complex Feature (multiple personas)
- **Domain**: Security, Performance, Frontend, Backend, etc.
- **Historical Success**: Learn from past similar task outcomes

### Progress Intelligence
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation progress against plan
- **Risk Detection**: Identify potential issues before they become blockers  
- **Resource Optimization**: Suggest more efficient approaches during execution
- **Quality Prediction**: Predict potential quality issues based on implementation patterns

## Interactive Execution

### User Interaction Patterns
```markdown
üéØ TASK EXECUTION: [Task Name]

## Current Status
- **Phase**: [Current implementation phase]
- **Progress**: [X/Y tasks completed]
- **Next Action**: [What's happening next]

## Continue?
- `yes` - Continue to next phase
- `pause` - Pause and save current progress
- `details` - Show detailed progress and next steps
- `escalate` - Increase complexity level and re-plan
```

### Adaptive Execution
- **User Preferences**: Learn user's preferred interaction style
- **Context Sensitivity**: Adjust interaction frequency based on task complexity
- **Progress Visibility**: Provide appropriate level of detail for task type
- **Decision Points**: Present key decisions and alternatives during execution

## File Management

### Universal File Handling
```markdown
## File Transition Log

**Start**: `workflow/planned/[task-name].md`
**Execution**: `workflow/in-progress/[task-name].md`
**Completion**: 
  - Success: `workflow/completed/done-[task-name].md`
  - Failure: `workflow/completed/fail-[task-name].md`

**Status Updates**: Real-time updates to task file during execution
**Dependency Updates**: Automatic dependency resolution tracking
**Progress Logging**: Detailed execution log for future reference
**Logbook Updates**: Automatic updates to workflow/logbook.md on status changes
```

### Automatic Logbook Updates

When task status changes, automatically update `workflow/logbook.md`:

**On Start Execution:**
- Move task from "Recently Planned" to "In Progress"
- Update "In Progress" count in Quick Overview
- Update "Last Activity" timestamp

**On Successful Completion:**
- Move task from "In Progress" to "Recently Completed - Successful"
- Update success counters and success rate
- Log lessons learned and completion notes

**On Failed Completion:**
- Move task from "In Progress" to "Recently Completed - Failed"  
- Update failure counters and success rate
- Log failure reasons and lessons learned

**On Pause:**
- Keep in "In Progress" but add pause status and reason
- Update "Last Activity" timestamp

### Execution Tracking
Each task file gets enhanced with execution metadata:

```markdown
## Execution Metadata

**Started**: [Timestamp]
**Context Level**: [3-Layer | 6-Layer | 11-Layer]
**Personas Active**: [List of active personas]
**Estimated Duration**: [Time estimate]
**Actual Duration**: [Actual time taken]
**Complexity Escalations**: [Any changes in complexity during execution]
**Challenges Encountered**: [Issues faced during implementation]
